# 🐠 Remotely Operated Underwater Robot (ROV) using Raspberry Pi
**Real-Time Navigation | Live Video Streaming | Temperature Monitoring** 🌊🤖

This project showcases a **tethered underwater robot** built with a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspberry Pi OS.  
Designed for **real-time control**, **live video feedback**, and **environmental sensing**, the ROV integrates brushless motors, electronic speed controllers (ESCs), and a waterproof temperature sensor.

## 🛠 Features

- **Four brushless motors** controlled via ESCs:
  - 2 for vertical (Z-axis) navigation
  - 2 mirrored for balanced horizontal (X-Y plane) movement
- **Torque-canceling propulsion** with mirrored propeller design
- **Real-time GUI** using PyQt, hosted directly on Raspberry Pi
- **Live video feed** via Raspberry Pi Camera
- **Waterproof temperature sensor** with CSV data logging
- **Reliable control** via tethered Ethernet (static IP) and RealVNC
- Powered by **3S LiPo battery**
